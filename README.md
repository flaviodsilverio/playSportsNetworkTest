Here's the finished test. 
I could've done a few more things but I did spend a bit more than the 3 hours specified for the exercise so I thought I better hand it in.

On the first time I read what was required I did miss the 3h time limit, that way I did prioritise some things I shouldn't have and I didn't do things I should've done.

Main points I missed:
- The List isn't ordered by date as requested. Initially when reading about the APIn I found the parameters "order=date" and assumed everything would be ordered. Only now, just before I commited it, did I notice it wasn't.
- The comments aren't paged. You get 100 comments per video, that's it.
- Only "Happy path" works. If there's no connection or the data doesn't come correctly there's no errors to the user. I planned on doing a proper "No Data View" but that was before I noticed I was supposed to only spend 3h on it.

I think that's pretty much it! 

Since I had no experience using the youtube API at all, I must say I'm satisfied with what I achieved, even if I missed the ordering that was requested. Probably if I had correctly read the 3h time limit I would've done a slightly different project, too late fot that now!
